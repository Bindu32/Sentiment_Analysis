#  Sentiment Analysis on Social Media Posts

This project analyzes the sentiment of airline-related tweets (positive, neutral, negative) using NLP and machine learning. Built as part of the **TechMaven Project 2**, it demonstrates a full ML pipeline from preprocessing to deployment on Streamlit Cloud.

---

##  Problem Statement

Classify the **sentiment** of social media posts based on their text content.  
Use real-world data to train and deploy a model that predicts whether a tweet is **positive**, **neutral**, or **negative**.

##  Workflow Summary

1. Data loading and cleaning
2. Text preprocessing (lemmatization, stopword removal, etc.)
3. TF-IDF vectorization
4. Label encoding
5. Logistic regression training (with class balancing)
6. Model evaluation (Confusion Matrix, F1)
7. Deployment via Streamlit Cloud
